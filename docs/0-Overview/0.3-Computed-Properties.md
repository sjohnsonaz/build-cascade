We've looked at creating **Observable** properties, which let us watch for changes in our **Application State**.  But how do our **Components** track those changes?

If you look at the `UserView.render` method, we simply read from our `User`.  Cascade tracked those changes for us automatically using **Computed** properties.  For our Components, this is done behind the scenes.  But we can use them in our Application State just as easily.

## Computed Properties

Cascade provides **Computed** properties for objects, which use a getter function to produce a value.  However, any **Observable** properties used in this function, will automatically produce subscriptions.

For simplicity, we can also use the `@observable` decorator, except in front of a getter function.

```` Typescript
@observable get property(): type {
    return this.value;
}
````

For our `User` let's add a `fullName` Computed property.  Add this right under the `firstName` and `lastName` properties.

```` Typescript
@observable get fullName() {
    return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
}
````

There are a couple things to note:

1. We simply used the values in order to subscribe to them automatically.
2. We can use as many values as we want.
3. Whatever we return from this method will be the value of the property.

## Subscribing Directly to Observables

There are two main ways of subscribing to **Observable** properties.  We may either subscribe directly, or through a **Computed** property, which we will examine next.

```` TypeScript
Cascade.subscribe<T>(obj: any, property: string, subscriberFunction: ISubscriberFunction<T>);
````

The `subscriberFunction` will be called any time the value of the property changes.  Keep in mind, simply storing an identical value to the property is not a change, and so there will be no notification.

## Hiding Reads

```` TypeScript
Cascade.peek(obj: any, property: string): any;
````

## Update Batching

## Computed Best Practices

### Responding to updates

```` TypeScript
Cascade.wrapContext(callback: () => any, thisArg?: any): IObservable<any[]>;
````

Do not write to an observable inside of a Computed.
